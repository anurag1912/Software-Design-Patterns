In this assignment, we are going to design and implement a framework for placing orders for buying and selling stocks. 
A client places orders for buying or selling stocks to an agent. The agent takes the orders and sends them to the StockTrade system. 
The Agent accepts orders 24x7, but the StockTrade system opens only between 9:30am to 4:00pm on weekdays. 
If client places orderoutside StockTrade working hours, the agent queues them to be processed later on.

The StockTrade system has the interface as below.
class StockTrade {
    public void buy(String symbol, int amount) {
        System.out.println("Buy " + amount + " " + symbol + " stocks");
    }
    public void sell(String symbol, int amount) {
        System.out.println("Sell " + amount + " " + symbol + " stocks");
    }
}
