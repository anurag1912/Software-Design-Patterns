Design a framework for a graphics editor to handle different shapes uniformly. The Shape interface is given as below.

A shape can be basic or complex. The basic shape is a line, where a complex shape is composed with other shapes. 
For example, a rectangle is made of four line objects.
The test cases should cover at least three shapes including Line, Triangle, Arrow (with triangle head).

public interface Shape {
  public void renderShapeToScreen(); // draw this shape on screen
  public Shape[] explodeShape(); // return the list of all basic shapes forming this shape
}
public class Line implements Shape {
  // instance variables
  public Line(int startX, int startY, int endX, int endY) {
    // set instance variables
  }
  public Shape[] explodeShape() {
    Shape[] shapeParts = {this};
    return shapeParts;
  }

  public void renderShapeToScreen() {
    System.out.println("\nDraw a line");
  }
}
